"You can upgrade to the latest version of Fedora manually instead of relying "

"if you were performing a clean installation, letting it detect your existing "
"Fedora system, and overwriting the root partition while preserving data on "
"other partitions and volumes. The same process can also be used to reinstall "
"the system, if you need to. For detailed information, see "

"除了使用 [application]*dnf system upgrade* 之外，你还可以手动完成系统升级。你可以引导安装介质并执行全新安装，"
"或者让安装程序探测你当前的 Fedora 系统，将根分区改写的同时保留其它的分区或卷。当然对于只重装不升级的情况，也是可以采取一样的方法的。具体可以查看 "
