"normally asked by the installation program, such as what time zone do you "
"want the system to use, how should the drives be partitioned or which "
"packages should be installed. Providing a prepared Kickstart file when the "
"installation begins therefore allows the you to perform the installation "
"automatically, without need for any intervention from the user. This is "
"especially useful when deploying {PRODUCT} on a large number of systems at "
