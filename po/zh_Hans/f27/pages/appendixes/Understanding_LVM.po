"LVM (Logical Volume Management) partitions provide a number of advantages "
"over standard partitions. LVM partitions are formatted as _physical "
"volumes_. One or more physical volumes are combined to form a _volume "
"group_. Each volume group's total storage is then divided into one or more "
"_logical volumes_. The logical volumes function much like standard "
"partitions. They have a file system type, such as `ext4`, and a mount point."

"To understand LVM better, imagine the physical volume as a pile of "
"_blocks_. A block is a storage unit used to store data. Several piles of "
"blocks can be combined to make a much larger pile, just as physical volumes "
"are combined to make a volume group. The resulting pile can be subdivided "
"into several smaller piles of arbitrary size, just as a volume group is "
"allocated to several logical volumes."

"要更好地理解LVM，可以把物理卷想象成一堆_块_。一个块代表一个用于储存数据的储存"

"An administrator may grow or shrink logical volumes without destroying data, "

"管理员可以扩大或缩小逻辑卷而无需破坏数据，这点不像标注分区一样。如果在卷组中"

"You may lose data if you shrink a logical volume to a smaller capacity than "

"space, as your needs dictate."

"如果你缩小一个逻辑卷到一个比卷需要的空间还小的空间，那么你也许会丢失数据。要"
"确保最大的灵活性，就要在创建逻辑卷时满足当前的需求，然后留出超量的、未分配的"
"储存空间。你可以安全地按需增加逻辑卷的空间来使用未分配的空间。"
