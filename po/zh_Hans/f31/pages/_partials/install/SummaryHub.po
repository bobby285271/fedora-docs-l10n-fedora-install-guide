"A *warning symbol* (yellow triangle with an exclamation mark) next to an "
"icon means that a screen requires your attention before you start the "
"installation. This typically happens with the `Installation Destination` "
"screen, because even though there is a default automatic partitioning "
"variant, you always have to at least confirm this selection, even if you do "
"not want to make any changes."
msgstr ""
"图标旁边显示着 *警告标志* （带有感叹号的黄色三角形）意味着在开始安装之前需要额外留意这个页面。通常安装路径页面对应的链接在初始时就是这样的，尽管有自动"

"If a link is *greyed out*, it means that the installer is currently "

"installation source in the `Installation Source` screen and the installer is "
"probing the new source location and gathering a list of available packages."
msgstr ""
"链接文字 *变灰* 意味着安装程序正在对这个页面的选项进行设置，在访问这个页面之前你必须等待安装程序完成有关的设置。当你修改了安装来源后通常就会有这种情况"
"发生，这是因为安装程序会花上一点时间探测新的安装来源并获取可用软件包列表。"

"Screens with *black text and no warning symbol* mean that this screen does "

"automatically, or set up on the previous screen where you select your "
"language and locale."

"链接文字 *黑色且无警告标志* 意味着这个页面无需你的特别留意。你依然可以进入这个页面并进行一些改动，但是这对于完成安装来说不再是必要的。这常见于区域设置"
