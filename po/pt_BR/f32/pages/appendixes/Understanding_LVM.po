"LVM (Logical Volume Management) partitions provide a number of advantages "
"over standard partitions. LVM partitions are formatted as _physical "
"volumes_. One or more physical volumes are combined to form a _volume "
"group_. Each volume group's total storage is then divided into one or more "
"_logical volumes_. The logical volumes function much like standard "
"partitions. They have a file system type, such as `ext4`, and a mount point."

"By default, the installation process always creates the `/` and `swap` "

"To understand LVM better, imagine the physical volume as a pile of _blocks_. "
"A block is a storage unit used to store data. Several piles of blocks can be "
"combined to make a much larger pile, just as physical volumes are combined "
"to make a volume group. The resulting pile can be subdivided into several "
"smaller piles of arbitrary size, just as a volume group is allocated to "
"several logical volumes."

"An administrator may grow or shrink logical volumes without destroying data, "
"unlike standard disk partitions. If the physical volumes in a volume group "
"are on separate drives or RAID arrays then administrators may also spread a "
"logical volume across the storage devices."

"You may lose data if you shrink a logical volume to a smaller capacity than "
"the data on the volume requires. To ensure maximum flexibility, create "
"logical volumes to meet your current needs, and leave excess storage "
"capacity unallocated. You may safely grow logical volumes to use unallocated "
"space, as your needs dictate."
