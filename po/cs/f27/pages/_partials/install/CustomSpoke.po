"In most other installers for both Linux and other operating systems, disk "
"partitioning usually takes a \"bottom-up\" approach. In these installers, "
"you first create underlying devices such as LVM physical volumes, then you "
"create a layout such as LVM on top of them, then you create file systems on "
"top of logical volumes, and the last step is usually assigning a mount point "
"to each volume as needed."

"[application]*Anaconda* uses an opposite approach. First, you create all "
"separate mount points you need, and everything needed to create them "
"(creating a volume group, logical volumes inside it, and physical volumes "
"where the volume group will reside) is performed automatically. You can then "
"adjust the automatic settings as you require."
