"[application]*Kdump* is a kernel crash dumping mechanism which, in the event "
"of a system crash, captures the contents of the system memory at the moment "
"of failure. This captured memory can then be analyzed to find the cause of "
"the crash. If [application]*Kdump* is enabled, it must have a small portion "
"of the system's memory (RAM) reserved to itself. This reserved memory will "
"not be accessible to the main kernel."
