"To use iSCSI storage devices, the installer must be able to discover them as "
"_iSCSI targets_ and be able to create an iSCSI session to access them. Both "
"of these steps may require a user name and password for _Challenge Handshake "
"Authentication Protocol_ (CHAP) authentication."

"You can also configure an iSCSI target to authenticate the iSCSI initiator "
"on the system to which the target is attached (_reverse CHAP_), both for "
"discovery and for the session. Used together, CHAP and reverse CHAP are "
"called _mutual CHAP_ or _two-way CHAP_. Mutual CHAP provides the greatest "
"level of security for iSCSI connections, particularly if the user name and "
"password are different for CHAP authentication and reverse CHAP "
"authentication."
