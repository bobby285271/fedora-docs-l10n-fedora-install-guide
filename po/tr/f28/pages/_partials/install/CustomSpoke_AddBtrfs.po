"_Btrfs_ is a type of file system, but it has several features characteristic "
"of a storage device. It is designed to make the file system tolerant of "
"errors, and to facilitate the detection and repair of errors when they "
"occur. It uses checksums to ensure the validity of data and metadata, and "
"maintains snapshots of the file system that can be used for backup or repair."

"Creating a Btrfs layout is somewhat similar to LVM (described in xref:"
"Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-"
"lvm[Creating a Logical Volume Managament (LVM) Layout]) with slightly "
"different terminology. A Btrfs _volume_ is the equivalent of an LVM volume "
"group, and a Btrfs _subvolume_ is similar to a LVM logical volume. An "
"important difference to note is how [application]*Anaconda* reports sizes "
"for separate mount points: For LVM, the exact size of each logical volume is "
"shown next to each mount point in the left pane, while with Btrfs, the total "
"size of the entire volume is shown next to each subvolume."
