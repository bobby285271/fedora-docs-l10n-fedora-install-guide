"There is no best way to partition every system; the optimal setup depends on "
"how you plan to use the system being installed. However, the following tips "
"may help you find the optimal layout for your needs:"
msgstr ""
"모든 시스템을 파티션 하는 가장 좋은 방법은 없습니다; 최적의 설정은 설치 중인 시스템의 사용 계획 방법에 따라 다릅니다. 하여간, 다음 "
"팁은 필요에 맞는 최적의 배열을 찾는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다:"

"Consider encrypting any partitions and volumes which might contain sensitive "
"data. Encryption prevents unauthorized people from accessing the data on the "
"partitions, even if they have access to the physical storage device. In most "
"cases, you should at least encrypt the `/home` partition, which contains "
"user data."
msgstr ""
"민감한 자료가 포함되어 있는 암호화된 파티션과 볼륨을 고려하세요. 암호화는 파티션에서 접근한 자료에서부터, 심지어 만약 이들이 물리적인 "
"저장 장치에 접근한다고 하더래도 허용하지 않은 사람들을 막아줍니다. 대부분의 경우에, 당신은 최소한 사용자 정보가 포함되어 있는 '/"
"home' 파티션은 암호화하기 바랍니다."

"In some cases, creating separate mount points for directories other than "
"`/`, `/boot` and `/home` may be useful; for example, on a server running a "
"[application]*MySQL* database, having a separate mount point for "
"`/var/lib/mysql` will allow you to preserve the database during a "
"reinstallation without having to restore it from backup afterwards. However, "
"having unnecessary separate mount points will make storage administration "
"more difficult."

"Some special restrictions apply to certain directories with regards on which "
"partitioning layouts can they be placed. Notably, the `/boot` directory must "
"always be on a physical partition (not on an LVM volume or a Btrfs "
"subvolume), and `/usr` can not be on a Btrfs subvolume."

"Each kernel installed on your system requires approximately 20 MB on the "
"`/boot` partition. The default partition size of 500 MB for `/boot` should "
"suffice for most common uses; increase the size of this partition if you "
"plan to keep many kernels installed at the same time."

"The `/var` directory holds content for a number of applications, including "
"the [application]*Apache* web server, and is used by the [application]*DNF* "
"package manager to temporarily store downloaded package updates. Make sure "
"that the partition or volume containing `/var` has at least 3 GB."

"The contents of the `/var` directory usually change very often. This may "
"cause problems with older solid state drives (SSDs), as they can handle a "
"lower number of read/write cycles before becoming unusable. If your system "
"root is on an SSD, consider creating a separate mount point for `/var` on a "
"classic (platter) HDD."

"The `/usr` directory holds the majority of software on a typical {PRODUCT} "
"installation. The partition or volume containing this directory should "
"therefore be at least 5 GB for minimal installations, and at least 10 GB for "
"installations with a graphical environment."

"If `/usr` or `/var` is partitioned separately from the rest of the root "
"volume, the boot process becomes much more complex because these directories "
"contain boot-critical components. In some situations, such as when these "
"directories are placed on an iSCSI drive or an FCoE location, the system may "
"either be unable to boot, or it may hang with a `Device is busy` error when "
"powering off or rebooting."

"This limitation only applies to `/usr` or `/var`, not to directories below "

"issues."

"Consider leaving a portion of the space in an LVM volume group "
"unallocated. This unallocated space gives you flexibility if your space "
"requirements change but you do not wish to remove data from other "
"volumes. You can also select the `Thin provisioning` device type for the "
"partition to have the unused space handled automatically by the volume."

"The size of an `XFS` file system can not be reduced - if you need to make a "
"partition or volume with this file system smaller, you must back up your "
"data, destroy the file system, and create a new, smaller one in its "
"place. Therefore, if you expect needing to manipulate your partitioning "
"layout later, you should use the `ext4` file system instead."

"Use Logical Volume Management (LVM) if you anticipate expanding your storage "
"by adding more hard drives after the installation. With LVM, you can create "
"physical volumes on the new drives, and then assign them to any volume group "
"and logical volume as you see fit - for example, you can easily expand your "
"system's `/home` (or any other directory residing on a logical volume)."

"Creating a BIOS Boot partition or an EFI System Partition may be necessary, "

"label. See "
"xref:Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-recommended[Recommended "
"Partitioning Scheme] for information about these partitions. Note that the "
