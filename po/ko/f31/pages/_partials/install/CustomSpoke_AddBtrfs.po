"_Btrfs_ is a type of file system, but it has several features characteristic "
"of a storage device. It is designed to make the file system tolerant of "
"errors, and to facilitate the detection and repair of errors when they "
"occur. It uses checksums to ensure the validity of data and metadata, and "
"maintains snapshots of the file system that can be used for backup or "
"repair."

"Creating a Btrfs layout is somewhat similar to LVM (described in "
"xref:Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-lvm[Creating "
"a Logical Volume Managament (LVM) Layout]) with slightly different "
"terminology. A Btrfs _volume_ is the equivalent of an LVM volume group, and "
"a Btrfs _subvolume_ is similar to a LVM logical volume. An important "
"difference to note is how [application]*Anaconda* reports sizes for separate "
"mount points: For LVM, the exact size of each logical volume is shown next "
"to each mount point in the left pane, while with Btrfs, the total size of "
"the entire volume is shown next to each subvolume."
