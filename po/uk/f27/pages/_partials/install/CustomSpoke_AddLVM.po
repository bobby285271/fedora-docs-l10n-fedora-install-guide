"_Logical Volume Management_ (LVM) presents a simple logical view of "
"underlying physical storage space, such as hard drives or LUNs. Partitions "
"on physical storage are represented as _physical volumes_ that can be "
"grouped together into _volume groups_. Each volume group can be divided into "
"multiple _logical volumes_, each of which is analogous to a standard disk "
"partition. Therefore, LVM logical volumes function as partitions which can "
"span multiple physical disks."
