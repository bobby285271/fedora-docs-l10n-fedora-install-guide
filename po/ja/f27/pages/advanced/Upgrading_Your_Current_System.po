"Fedora system, and overwriting the root partition while preserving data on "

"Unfortunately, we have not written this chapter yet, and there is no "
"dedicated documentation about a manual reinstall on the Wiki, either. In the "
"meantime before we fix this, you can try to start the installation normally "
"(from a boot CD/DVD/USB), select manual partitioning in your installer, and "
"reuse existing partitions instead of destroying them and creating new ones. "
"The instructions at xref:../install/Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-"
