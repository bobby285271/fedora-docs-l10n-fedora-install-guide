"This section only details the most important settings for a typical wired "
"connection used during installation. Many of the available options do not "
"have to be changed in most installation scenarios and are not carried over "
"to the installed system. Configuration of other types of networks is broadly "
"similar, although the specific configuration parameters may be different. To "
"learn more about network configuration after installation, see the "

"To configure a network connection manually, select that connection in the "
"list on the left side of the screen, and click the `Configure` button. A "
"dialog will appear that allows you to configure the selected connection. The "
"configuration options presented depends on the connection type - the "
"available options will be slightly different depending on whether it is a "
"physical interface (wired or wireless network interface controller) or a "
"virtual interface (Bond, Team or Vlan) which you previously configured in "
"xref:install/Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-network-"

"startup (unless you unplug the network cable); on a wireless connection, it "
