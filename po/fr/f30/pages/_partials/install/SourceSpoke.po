"The `Installation Source` screen allows you to specify a location (local or "

"Normally, when you first enter the `Installation Summary` screen, the "
"installer will attempt to configure an installation source based on the type "
"of media you used to boot. The full {PRODUCT} Server DVD will configure the "
"source as local media, the netinst ISO image will configure the closest "
"network mirror, etc. This process takes some time, especially if the default "
"source is a network mirror. If you plan to use a custom installation source, "
"use the [option]#inst.askmethod# boot option to skip the initial "
"configuration; this will allow you to enter this screen immediately. See "
"xref:advanced/Boot_Options.adoc#sect-boot-options-sources[Specifying the "
