"_Standard partitions_ are the most common type of partition, with the widest "
"support across operating systems. For example, Microsoft Windows uses "
"exclusively physical partitions and can not natively work with LVM or Btrfs. "
"Most {PRODUCT} partitioning setups will also require at least one standard "
"partition for the `/boot` directory, and possibly also another standard "
"partition with the BIOS Boot or EFI System file system to store the boot "
"loader."
