"The [application]*Anaconda* installer includes a range of boot options for "
"administrators, which modify the default behavior of the installation "
"program by enabling or disabling certain functions. To use one or more boot "
"options, you either have to boot from installation media and append these "
"options at the boot menu (see "
"xref:install/Booting_the_Installation.adoc#sect-boot-menu[The Boot Menu]), "
"or you must add them into your PXE server configuration file if you are "
